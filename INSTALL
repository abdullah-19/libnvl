Before you compile and install the Nicta libraries, you will need to first install a host of 
3rd party libraries; these are broken down into the following:

1. OpenCV and its dependencies [including but not limited to:  libraw1394, libdc1394, libdc1394-control]
2. Optionally, the PGR libraries and headers if you intend to use PGR stereo cameras
3. `flite' (cut down version of `festival') for functionality of nicta_common/sound.{h,cc}
4. CppUnit to execute the unit-tests
5. C++ Boost Libraries (something current, 1.42 and above)
6. A current GCC (4.4.2 and above) ..as we use some C++0x features here


Instructions on how to install OpenCV (among other 3rd party libraries) are to be
found in the subdriectory under here:  `3rd-party/doc/' therein, you **SHOULD**
read the file named README therein.



---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT:

You should only use the OpenCV distributed with **THIS** release, since there are 
bug fixes here not available on the main trunk, and furthermore is a consequence
of the guys at OpenCV having broken interface more times than I care to count in
the course of development of these libraries.  Contained herein is a patched
OpenCV-1.1_pre1 release with fixes to work under linux (including file-writing),
and bugs fixes to cvMatND predominantly, among others!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------



To install the Nicta libraries in this package, you must run `make install' at the
command line, and provide an **ABSOLUTE** directory path of where you would like
these libraries installed FROM THIS (the top-level) DIRECTORY.

Example:  to install the libraries under /usr/local/opt/nicta, issue the following at
          the command line (CL) prompt:

              CL>  make install INSTALL_PATH=/usr/local/opt/nicta


The majority of libraries here are header-file only, however, there are 2 or 3 that
are not, so you will then need to appropriately set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment
variable:

..continuing with the example above, you would (for a bash shell), set the following
in your .bashrc resource file:

              export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/opt/nicta/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH


When you compile code using any of these libraries, you will need to ensure that GCC
can find the library includes, so be sure to issue a -I/path/to/these/library/includes;

..in the spirit of the above, assuming you installed the libraries to /usr/local/opt/nicta
then your include path would be:

              -I/usr/local/opt/nicta/include



---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE:

These libraries have been developed and tested under Linux (both 32bit & 64bit), 
and expect them to work under any POSIX platform.  No testing or development under
Windows has been done, so I can not speak of any support for that platform.
